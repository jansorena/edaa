# Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains experiments and source code for performance testing of various algorithms and data structures.

## Repository Structure

### Boletin_1:
- Search Algorithms
    - Sequential Search
    - Binary Search
    - Galloping Search

### Boletin_2:
- Tree Data Structures
    - AVL Tree

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang)
- Bash shell (for running the experiment scripts)

### Building the Project

To compile the source files, you can use the following commands:

```sh
g++ -O0 -std=c++20 -Wall -Wpedantic -o <executable-name> <file.cpp>
```
